- 2021-09-06 :: 'gzip' has been renamed to 'pigz'. You need
  to run the following to switch between packages:

        cpt bi pigz
        cpt a | grep ^pigz | cpt a -
        cpt r gzip

- 2021-08-10 :: 'm4' is no longer part of the standard base

- 2021-07-31 :: otools 'grep' seems to break the build
  system of certain packages, you are advised to replace
  it by running:

        cpt a busybox /usr/bin/grep
