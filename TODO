TESTING/WEBKIT2GTK
* development version (2.29.1) doesn't build with gstreamer

TESTING/BEARSSL
* build the base with bearssl instead of libressl
   - [ ] curl    (builds but with certain caveats)
   - [x] git
   - [ ] busybox (busybox wget doesn't check for tls certificates)
                 bearssl can do client connections with the same command
                 but busybox looks for openssl.
